# coverletter-automation
A lightweight tool to auto-generate cover letters from structured data

## Project Background
Writing personalized cover letters for each job application is essential but often time-consuming and repetitive. Many applicants struggle to maintain consistency and efficiency when tailoring content to multiple roles across different companies

This project addresses that challenge by automating the cover letter creation process. By inputting details like the company name and job description, users can quickly generate customized PDF cover lettersâ€”saving time while ensuring a professional and personalized result every time.

## Project Goal
This project aims to automate the generation of personal cover letters in PDF by using **Python Jupyter Notebook** and **Microsoft Word** based on the company name and job title to streamlines the application process and saves time during online job submissions.
